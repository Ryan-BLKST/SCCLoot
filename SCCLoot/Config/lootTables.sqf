// Loot Tables

// By default this list contains items from ARMA 3 only.
// However, items not found are ignored - making it safe to add items from mods here.
// Format is classname, spawn chance.

// Default loot that will spawn in any building not defined in the config file:
scclootDefault = [
	["U_Competitor",100]
];

// Civilian loot
scclootCivil = [
	["B_AssaultPack_blk",100],
	["arifle_MX_F",100]
];

// Industrial loot
scclootIndustrial = [
	["arifle_MX_F",100]
];

	["launch_NLAW_F",100]
